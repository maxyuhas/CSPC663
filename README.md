# CSPC663
Repository for my assignments and projects from my graduate level Deep Learning course.
I have included several assignments exploring different deep learning models, techniques, theory, and applications.
These include derivations of backpropogation, discussions of the differences between network architectures, and example problems with
multiperceptron networks, autoencoders, and more.
I ahve also included my final project report, which is an exploration of variational autoencoders. I wanted to explore the
reconstructive capabilities of different VAE architectures and their latent space representations on the cifar-10 dataset, a more complex
10 category dataset compared to the MNIST digits.
