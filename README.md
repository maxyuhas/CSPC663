# CSPC663 - Deep Learning
Repository for my assignments and projects from my graduate level Deep Learning course. 

I have included several assignments exploring different deep learning models, techniques, theory, and applications.
These include derivations of backpropogation, discussions of the differences between network architectures, and example problems with
multiperceptron networks, autoencoders, and more. All the code was written in Python and the neural networks were built with both TensorFlow and Keras.
  
  - Assignment 1 contains an exploration of machine learning methods, simple multiperceptron networks, and a discussion of different deep learning models.
  - Assignment 2 contains a theoretical understanding of gradient descent and backpropogation, a simple manual implementation of backpropogation, and experiments with different losses and regularization methods for a multilayer neural network.
  - Assignment 3 contians a step-by-step understaning of TensorFlow, an exploration of hyperparameters and learning rates, an experiment with autoencoders, and a discussion on more complex deep learning networks-variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).
  - Assignment 4 contains an exploration of convolutional neural networks and comparisons between principal components analysis (PCA) and autoencoders.
  - I have also included my final project report, which is an exploration of variational autoencoders. I wanted to explore the
reconstructive capabilities of different VAE architectures and their latent space representations on the cifar-10 dataset, a more complex
10 category dataset compared to the MNIST digits.
